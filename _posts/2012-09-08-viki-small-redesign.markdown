![Viki.com simple](http://f.cl.ly/items/0C1M0b1F303a1O1J2H2g/Screen%20shot%202012-09-08%20at%2010.29.47%20AM.png)

Woke up today to watch/sub some shows on [Viki.com](http://www.viki.com). Naturally having an eye for design, I decided to quickly mockup a "simplified" version of Viki sans the intensive graphics that currently reside on their site. Slimmed down the palette to 4 core colors for site presentation and removed webfonts where not needed on their show info page. The results is the screenshot above.
