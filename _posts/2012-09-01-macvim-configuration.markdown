title: MacVim Configuration
---

So brew makes life so much easier when installing packages
locally(So long MacPorts, I despise you !). So In a
perfect world a ``$ brew install package-name`` should get you up and
running with said package-name. But I'm not going to go into details
about brew, instead I'll be talking about macvim and configuring it to a
tasteful degree(perhaps maybe half assed ? ... je ne sais pas).
